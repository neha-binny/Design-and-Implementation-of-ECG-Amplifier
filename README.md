# Design-and-Implementation-of-ECG-Amplifier
This project describes how the ECG bio-signal conditioning circuitry can be designed. The circuit uses an instrumentation amplifier to amplify the ECG signal obtained from the potential difference between the right and left arm electrodes, a low-pass filter to remove high-frequency noise, a high-pass filter to remove the very low-frequency noises, a notch filter to filter out the power line interference. and a half-wave rectifier to remove the negative signal. The circuit is simulated using LtSpice and the PCB Layout is made using Kicad.
